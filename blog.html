            <p>The Canon Rebel T7 is by far the best DSLR camera for any beginner. Most people are too scared to 
                try out a DSLR camera because typically they're associated with above average skilled photographers. 
                But this camera is definitely a camera anyone can learn and get extremely insane photos with some practice. 
                Did I forget to mention that this camera also has full HD video recording capabilities. If you’re new to 
                photography or need a device that will record your videos for Youtube, etc. I highly recommend this camera 
                for you and to improve your skills. With its retail price set at $449.99, it's quite affordable and well 
                worth the price. Click the link below to see the specifications for this camera.</p>

            <p>Can Rivian compete with Tesla, maybe, maybe not. Rivian starting trading today and its I.P.O is being valued at
                $70 billion and offering $78 per share. There is a lot of hype surrounding this company but for some reason I 
                smell another Nikola.</p>

            <p>3, 2, 1… Let’s Jam. The much awaited live action remake by Netflix has seemed to have failed with audiences 
                everywhere. Just like everyone else I too was a little disappointed with it but nonetheless, I did enjoy it 
                and thought it was good, not great but good. The show stayed true to the original anime in which we can all 
                agree was awesome and rare to see. The cast and crew did a great job bringing the show to life but fight 
                scenes and acting at times seemed dull and fake to me. Certain scenes came directly from the anime series but 
                just felt different. But for someone looking for a decent show to watch with some ok fight scenes/entertainment 
                then I recommend this show to you. All I have to say is that certain shows shouldn’t be remade because nothing 
                beats the original. See you space cowboy.</p>

            <h2>Tesla Drivers Left Unable to Start Their Cars</h2>

            <p>Tesla drivers stated they were locked out of their cars early Saturday morning. Apparently
                there was a power outage that struck the companies app, up to 500 users had error messages 
                from the Tesla app and were locked out of thier vehicles. Stuart Masson, editor of The Car 
                Expert website, told the BBC. "The app is not the only way to access the cars though". You 
                know I've worked in automotive for a long time and not once have I ever met a person who has
                read there owners manual, it's there for a reason. Also could this be a downward trend for the 
                automaker, just a couple of days ago a news article was published stating that the automaker
                ranks dead last on consumer reports reliability.</p>

            <p>Reuters.com published an article on November 19th, stating that the Tesla company has been subjecting
                women to "nightmarish" working conditions. Jessica Barazza of Modesto, who works for the Tesla plant 
                Fremont, has stated that she has delt with constant catcalls, inapproriate touching from her coworkers
                during her night shifts. Jessica has reported these incidents to the HR deparment but nothing was done 
                to stop the harrasment from happening. To be reported and nothing done is unacceptable, Tesla should 
                award Jessica for all damages done to her and for the company to make major changes. Elon Musk himself 
                has run into issues, look at the insidehook article about using the number 69 and 420. For his age to be 
                so immature and open about it, I do think Elon has done great things especailly for the future when it comes 
                to technology but his behaviour has been a concern. If I was a major stockholder and on the board of Tesla, 
                I definitely would want him to step down from his role and out of the spot light.</p>

            <p>WHO THE HELL ARE THESE GUYS??? Since their debut on Satruday Night Live the 3 comedic genuises Martin Herlihy,
                Jimmy Higgins, and Ben Marshall, have made me watch the show again. We all know with SNL that comedians come 
                and go and things aren't the same with out them. For example, if you're a fan of the show you might remember
                Lonely Island which featured Andy Samberg, Akiva Schaffer and Jorma Taccone. Short sketches but were very 
                hilarious and had the same level of comedy, when they left the show so did their comedy. But once I saw the 
                Please Don't Destroy Video on SNL, it 100% reminded me of them and brought back the same level of comedic vide 
                with them. The show in my opinion is being held alive with them and of course the awesome Kenan Thompson.
                <br><br>P.S. Weekend update is still good too.</p>
